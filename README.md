# Db2 index of free resources in Internet

The index is maintained via the Wiki of this project.
You can modify the Wiki to update the index.

[Db2-Index - Wiki https://github.com/angoca/db2-index/wiki](https://github.com/angoca/db2-index/wiki)

However, that wiki git repository is cloned into the main git project to generate this GitHub page.
The clone can be accessed at:

 * [Db2-Index A-L concepts](Home.md)
 * [Db2-Index M-# concepts](Home-cont.md)

The sources from which this index is created from are these: [Main-sources.md](Main-sources.md)

# Purpose of this project

This project aims to provide a content index about all DB2 for LUW terms/concepts.
This is not a documentation repository; instead, it is like the index of a book,
where Internet is the book.
This repository contains a lot of web references (URLs) to different sites
that explains a particular concept in DB2.

The index itself is in the Wiki of this GitHub project.
Anyone can modify the wiki. You just need to have a GitHub account and have
signed in.

The index (the links) are cloned in the "code" part, because that needs a push
and sometimes a pull request to finally merge it.
For this reason, any modification in the wiki will no be automatically visible
in the main project or in the GitHub page.

You are welcome to reference your entries.
