[Access the Index - Wiki](https://github.com/angoca/db2-index/wiki)

This project aims to provide a content index about all DB2 for LUW terms/concepts.
This is not a documentation repository; instead, it is like the index of a book,
and the Internet is the book.
This repository contains a lot of web references (URLs) to different sites
that explains a particular concept in DB2.

The index itself is in the Wiki of this GitHub project.
Anyone can modify the wiki. You just need to have a GitHub account and be
signed in.

The index (the links) are not in the "code" part, because that needs a push
and sometimes a pull request to finally merge it.
Instead, editing directly in the wiki allows to anyone modify the content
which provides a better interaction.

You are welcome to reference your entries.
